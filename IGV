From the screen shot taken, the RNA seq data shows the expression of genes being expressed while the ATAC peaks show where regions of open chromatin
 are located in the genome. The green tall peaks shows that some gene is being expressed and the ORC data shows where the DNA replication is initiated. 
Moving from left to right on the file you will see the exon in purple at the bottom and the peaks from the RNA seq data which shows the transcription 
of mRNA of the exon region.
Moving right from there, the RNA seq  results had some peaks indicating that RNA is being transcribed. Part of the genome is missing annotations 
for that region and thus, it could perhaps be that some non-coding RNA is being transcribed. Peaks were also seen for the ATAC indicating the opening 
of chromatin for access to DNA to be transcribed. The OCR bar in red indicates that DNA replication is taking place. Where the second exon 
(left to right) is, you can see ATAC peaks and peaks from the RNA seq data indicating transcription of that coding region of the exon. 
Where the introns are located, there is no transcription of RNA as they do not code for protein.  
This can be seen by the flat lines for the RNA seq data and the minsicule peaks forming for the ATAC data.
